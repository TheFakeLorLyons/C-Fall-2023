# C-Fall-2023

This is work that I did during my fall semester of 2023 when I took a course on C. I am currently learning clojure, but I am very interested in C as a programming language still; and it feels more natural to me than any other language I have used. These examples are derivative but serve as the foundation for my education, so I figured I would upload them to github.
